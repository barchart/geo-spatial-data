# Overview

## Description

Our Geospatial Ag Data offering consists of two different "products" which are derived through the processing of satellite imagery using proprietary techniques developed by Barchart.  Largely these can be broken down as follows:
* **Vegetation Measurement & Scoring** - These are derived measures such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) that provide insights into the progress of crop emergence and growth development.  Measure like this are typically used to create forecasts for yield and production for a given crop.
* **Crop Classifications** - Crop classifications are used to identify what crop is growing on a specific area of a map - or in our case a pixel from a satellite image clipping.  These classifications are based on three important features of crops, NDVI, EVI and NDWI. The training data comes from Sentinel-2 level-2A satelliate images.

## Product Roadmap
Our capabilities in this space are growing by the day and we're excited to partner with our clients to scale out our geospatial platfom even further.  Throughout 2021 our primary focus will be to increase coverage through the addition of new domiciles inclusive of South America.

We're always learning and looking to improve our product, so please consider yourself a partner in this service.  If you have ideas on where we should go next please let us know - cmdty@barchart.com
